# Hi there, I'm Shawn (shazogg) 👨‍💻

**Computer Science Student @ Université de Toulouse (UPS)**

I am a software developer with 10+ years of experience in the Minecraft ecosystem, now specializing in **low-level systems**, **language design**, and **embedded architectures**. I build modular, scalable, and secure software using a wide array of modern technologies.
